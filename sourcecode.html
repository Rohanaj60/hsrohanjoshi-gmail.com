	<h3>Subjects of study</h3>
At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall <br>somewhere in the realm of scien. and rechnology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just <br>the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the id.s you submitted we were most intrigued <br>by are as follows, in order of priority:
<ol>
	<li>Turning H20 into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H1203)
</li>
<li>
	Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the <br> audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 103 increasing to 3 x 104.)

</li>
<li>
	HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.
</li>
</ol>

</p>
<h3>Exotic dance move
</h3>
<li>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work,1 did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,<br> my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</li><br>
Polynesian chicken dance
A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300 BC. a whole village would dance around <br>in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".<br>
Before the Icelanders developed fire as a m.ns of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which <br> involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably <br> tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired <br>modern styles such as Tweaking <br>
Arctic robot dance <br>
An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have <br> discovered a new dance style characterised by °robotic", stilt. movements, being practiced by inhabitants <br>of Northern Alaska and Cana.. Latcr on however it was discovered that they were just moving this <br> bccausc thcy wcrc really .Id.</p>

Yours sincerely, <br> <br>
